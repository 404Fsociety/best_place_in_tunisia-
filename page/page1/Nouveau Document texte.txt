            <p>Kairouan's medina (old town) is the most atmospheric and best preserved in Tunisia, the tightly packed alleyways giving a taste of the Arab empires. 
                Unlike the prettified old towns of Hammamet and Djerba, the old town here is the real deal, and strolling the lanes is number one on most visitor's things to do list.               
                The medina is surrounded by a 3.5-kilometer-long circuit of brick walls reinforced by numerous towers built by the Husseinites in the early 18th century.          
                Inside the walls, lanes ramble in a maze of directions. The best way to explore is simply to throw away the map and wander.
                As well as being home to most of Kairouan's tourist sightseeing draws, the narrow roads lined with colorful, paint-peeling houses are attractions themselves.
                You could spend hours here just soaking up the old town's beautiful architecture. Even if you're short on time, don't miss spending a few hours just walking around.

            <p>One of Kairouan's major points of interest, the Great Mosque stands in the northeast corner of the medina, its massive minaret incorporated into the town walls.
                This is the oldest and most important Islamic building in North Africa and was originally built by Uqba ibn Nafi, the Arab commander who founded Kairouan in AD 672.
                Many of Tunisia's other major mosques, including the Great Mosque of Sousse, took their inspiration from Kairouan's Great Mosque architecture.
                The mosque covers a mammoth area, 135 meters long by 80 meters wide, with a vast inner courtyard surrounded on three sides by double-aisled colonnades of antique columns.
                Non-Muslims can enter the courtyard area but are not allowed to enter the prayer hall, though the doors are often kept open, so you can have a peek inside.
